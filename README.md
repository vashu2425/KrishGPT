## Key Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines information retrieval and language generation to provide accurate, context-rich answers from the Bhagavad Gita.
- **Document Processing:** The Bhagavad Gita PDF is processed, split into text chunks, and embedded for efficient search and retrieval.
- **Vector-Based Search:** Uses FAISS for fast and efficient retrieval of relevant text chunks.
- **Contextual Answers:** Responses include source references from the Bhagavad Gita.
- **Translation to Hindi:** Allows users to translate responses into Hindi for accessibility.
- **Predefined Questions:** Offers a set of spiritual and philosophical questions for easy exploration.
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly chat experience.

## How It Works

1. **Document Loading:** The Bhagavad Gita PDF is loaded and split into smaller text chunks.
2. **Embeddings Generation:** Chunks are transformed into embeddings using `sentence-transformers`.
3. **Vector Search:** FAISS retrieves the most relevant text chunks based on the query.
4. **Contextual Response Generation:** The system uses retrieved chunks to generate a meaningful answer.
5. **Translation (Optional):** Users can translate responses into Hindi for better comprehension.
